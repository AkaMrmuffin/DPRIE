### Downwind Plume Road Intersectrion Estimator (DPRIE)

The Downwind Plume Road Intersectrion Estimator (DPRIE) is an open-source geosaptial tool for assiting the operational deployment of Sersor Equipped Vechile (SEV) in terms of sensing methane emissions.  

With different types of wind data inputs, DPRIE can perform differnt tasks. 
- With historical wind data, DPRIE can evaluate the operational effectiveness and suitability of different measurement methods for SEVs. 
- With forecast wind data, DPRIE can estimate the location of emission plume crosses for SEVs 

We created two versions of DPRIE, if you were familier with ArcGIS/ArcPy, as well as have an access to ArcGIS, ArcGIS-DPRIE is a better choice for you. For the users that don't have access to ArcGIS, we created a Python based DPRIE by using free python GIS-related packages.
